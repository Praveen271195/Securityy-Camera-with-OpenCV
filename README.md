## Motivation:
This repository was created to contain the motion detection and alarm system built with Python using OpenCV library for experential learnning pupose. 

## Future goal:
This project will later be developed in required format to program a Raspberry Pi to implement in my dad's office and godown for security purpose.

## Synopsis:
Motion detetion is one of the best applications of OpenCV and this is has been used to build acan be 

## Instructions:
Face detection using Haar cascades is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained with a set of input data. OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smiles, etc.. We are using face classifier in this project. You can experiment with other classifiers as well. 

- You need to download the trained classifier XML file (haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml), which is available in OpenCv’s GitHub repository.
- The detection works only on grayscale images/frames from video. So it is important to convert the color image to grayscale.
- detectMultiScale function is used to detect the faces. It takes 3 arguments — the input image, scaleFactor and minNeighbours. 
- scaleFactor specifies how much the image/frame size is reduced with each scale. minNeighbours specifies how many neighbors each candidate rectangle should have to retain it. 
- You may have to tweak these values to get the best results.
- Faces contains a list of coordinates for the rectangular regions where faces were found. We use these coordinates to draw the rectangles over the detected face.
